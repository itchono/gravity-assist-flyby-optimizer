# Gravity Assist Flyby Optimizer
This is a personal project about determining optimal gravity-assist based flyby trajectories for interplanetary missions. The goal is to determine the optimal trajectory for a spacecraft to fly from one planet to another using the least amount of fuel. The project is written in Python and is accelerated using C extensions. The project is currently in the early stages of development.
