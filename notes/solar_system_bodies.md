# Position Determination
Planetary body positions are obtained from the DE440 JPL ephemeris. The ephemeris is a set of 3D position and velocity vectors for the planets and the sun. The ephemeris yields position vectors in the J2000 barycentric frame. Note that J2000 is aligned with Earth's axial tilt, and is therefore about 23.5 degrees rotated from the solar system ecliptic.
