# Position Determination
Planetary body positions are obtained from the DE440 JPL ephemeris. The ephemeris is a set of 3D position and velocity vectors for the planets and the sun. The vectors are given in the ICRS coordinate system. The vectors are given at a set of discrete times. The vectors are interpolated to obtain the position at any time.
